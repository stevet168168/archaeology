An Z80 assembler file suitable for use with Sinclair ZX Spectrum emulators. The initial version recreates exactly the original ROM. The ROM itself is copyright Amstrad plc. The original annotations are by Geoff Wearmouth and those people credited in the file itself.

The modifications are my own, though many are based on bug reports available on the web. The precise nature of many of the bug reports mean my fix is likely to be exactly equivalent to previously published versions.
