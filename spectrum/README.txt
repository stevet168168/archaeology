A potential ROM file for use with ZX Spectum emulators. The initial version is taken from (the now defunct) http://www.wearmouth.demon.co.uk/zx82.htm and recreates the original ROM.
The original ROM is copyright Amstrad plc, the modifications are my own. Consider those modifications to be in the public domain.
